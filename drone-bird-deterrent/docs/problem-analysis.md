# Problem Analysis - Drone Bird Deterrent System

## Detailed Requirements Analysis

### Mission Profile
- **Primary Mission**: Medicine delivery to remote hilly areas
- **Total Distance**: 10 km one-way
- **Critical Attack Zone**: 5 km from origin (50% of journey)
- **Terrain**: Hilly region with elevation changes
- **Weather**: Prone to drizzles and wind gusts

### Threat Assessment

#### Bird Species in Hilly Regions
1. **Eagles**: Large raptors, territorial, aggressive
   - Size: 60-100 cm wingspan
   - Attack pattern: Diving from above
   - Threat level: HIGH

2. **Crows**: Intelligent, group hunters
   - Size: 40-50 cm wingspan
   - Attack pattern: Coordinated group attacks
   - Threat level: MEDIUM-HIGH

3. **Hawks**: Fast, precise attackers
   - Size: 35-65 cm wingspan
   - Attack pattern: High-speed intercepts
   - Threat level: MEDIUM

#### Attack Characteristics
- **Altitude**: Typically 50-200m above ground
- **Speed**: 20-80 km/h depending on species
- **Motivation**: Territorial defense, perceived threat to nest
- **Timing**: More aggressive during breeding season

### Technical Constraints

#### Weight Budget (1.5 kg max)
- Deterrent electronics: ~400g
- Power system: ~600g
- Mounting hardware: ~300g
- Protective housing: ~200g
- **Total**: 1.5 kg

#### Cost Budget (Rs. 50,000 max)
- Electronics & sensors: Rs. 25,000
- Power systems: Rs. 10,000
- Mechanical components: Rs. 8,000
- Development & testing: Rs. 5,000
- Contingency: Rs. 2,000

#### Environmental Requirements
- **Temperature**: -5°C to 45°C
- **Humidity**: Up to 95% (drizzle conditions)
- **Wind resistance**: Up to 40 km/h gusts
- **Vibration**: Drone flight dynamics
- **IP Rating**: IP65 minimum

### Success Criteria
1. **Primary**: 95% successful deterrent rate against bird attacks
2. **Secondary**: No mission failures due to bird interference
3. **Tertiary**: System operates reliably in all weather conditions
4. **Quaternary**: Easy integration with existing drone platforms

### Risk Analysis

#### High Risk
- System failure during critical medicine delivery
- Inadequate power for full mission duration
- Weather-related component failure

#### Medium Risk
- False positive activations draining battery
- Mechanical failure due to vibration
- Interference with drone navigation systems

#### Low Risk
- Component obsolescence
- Regulatory compliance issues
- Manufacturing defects

## Design Philosophy
**Redundancy**: Multiple deterrent methods for reliability
**Efficiency**: Smart activation to conserve power
**Robustness**: Weather-resistant design for harsh conditions
**Modularity**: Easy maintenance and upgrades
