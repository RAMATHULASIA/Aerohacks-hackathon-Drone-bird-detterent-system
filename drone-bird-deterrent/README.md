# Drone Bird Deterrent System - Aerohacks 2025

## Problem Statement
Design a system for a drone to deter bird attacks and safely traverse the remaining distance to destination for medicine delivery in hilly regions.

### Key Requirements:
- **Flight Distance**: 10 km total to destination
- **Critical Zone**: Bird attacks occur around 5 km from origin
- **Cost Constraint**: ≤ Rs. 50,000
- **Weight Constraint**: ≤ 1.5 kg
- **Environmental Conditions**: Hilly terrain with drizzles and wind gusts
- **Mission**: Medicine delivery (critical cargo)

## Solution Overview
Multi-layered bird deterrent system combining:
1. **Active Deterrents**: Ultrasonic emitters, LED strobes
2. **Passive Deterrents**: Visual markers, physical barriers
3. **Smart Detection**: Computer vision for threat assessment
4. **Adaptive Response**: Context-aware deterrent activation
