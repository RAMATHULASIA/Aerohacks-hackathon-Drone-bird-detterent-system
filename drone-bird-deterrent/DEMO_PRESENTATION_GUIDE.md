## 🔧 **Technical Q&A Preparation**

### **Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How do you ensure the system doesn't interfere with drone navigation?"**
A: "We use specific frequencies for audio (below 8kHz) and LED strobes that don't interfere with GPS or camera systems. All components are EMI tested."

**Q: "What happens if the battery runs low?"**
A: "The system has three power monitoring circuits and automatically switches to emergency mode at 30% battery, prioritizing mission completion over deterrent intensity."

**Q: "How do you handle different bird species?"**
A: "Our AI system identifies species and selects appropriate deterrent methods. Eagles get high-intensity treatment, while smaller birds need less aggressive deterrents."

**Q: "What about regulatory compliance?"**
A: "The system operates within DGCA guidelines for drone modifications and uses ISM band frequencies that don't require special licensing."
